== Data Structures
A data structure called device-context (DC) is used by the IOMMU to associate
a device with an address space and to hold other per-device parameters used
by the IOMMU to perform address translations. A radix-tree data structure called
device directory table (DDT) traversed using the `device_id` is used to hold
the DC.

Two formats of the device-context structure are supported:

* *Base Format* - A 32-byte DC used when MSI address translation using
  MSI flat page table and redirection of MSI to memory-resident interrupt files
  (MRIFs) are not supported.

* *Extended Format* - In the extended format a 64-byte device context is used
  and extends the base device context with additional information for
  processing MSIs.

DC associates the device, identified by `device_id`,  with a
guest-physical-address space by providing a pointer to a G-stage page
table and a virtual machine identifier called the guest soft-context ID
(`GSCID`).

To support devices with multiple process contexts, the DC points to a
radix-tree data structure called the Process Directory Table (PDT) used to
associate a `process_id` with a virtual address space. The PDT is used to hold
the pointer to a S or VS-stage page table for a `process_id`.

The DDT may be configured to be a 1, 2, or 3 level radix table depending on
the maximum width of the `device_id` supported. The partitioning of the
`device_id` to obtain the device directory indexes (DDI) to traverse the DDT
radix-tree table are as follows:

.Base format `device_id` partitioning

....
{reg: [
  {bits: 7, name: 'DDI[0]'},
  {bits: 9, name: 'DDI[1]'},
  {bits: 8, name: 'DDI[2]'},
], config:{lanes: 1, hspace:1024, fontsize: 16}}

], config:{lanes: 1, hspace:1024, fontsize: 16}}
....

The PDT may be configured to be a 1, 2, or 3 level radix table depending on the
maximum width of the `process_id` supported.  Each process directory table entry
is 16-byte wide and provides the pointer to a S or VS-stage page table, the
address translation scheme and an identifier for the process address space
called the Process soft-context ID (`PSCID`).
The partitioning of the `process_id` to obtain the process directory indices
(PDI) to traverse the PDT radix-tree table are as follows:

[NOTE]
====
All RISC-V IOMMU implementations are required to support DDT and PDT located
in main memory. Supporting data structures in I/O memory is not required.

=== Device-Directory-Table (DDT)
DDT is upto 3-level radix tree indexed using the device directory index (DDI)
bits of the `device_id`.

The following diagrams illustrate the DDT radix-tree. The root device-directory
page number is located using a memory-mapped control register called the
device-directory-table pointer (`ddtp`). Each non-leaf (`NL`) entry provides the
PPN of the next level device-directory-table page. The leaf device directory
table entry holds the device-context (`DC`).

....

`DC` is valid if the `V` bit is 1; if it is 0, all other bits in `DC` are
don't-care and may be freely used by software.

If the IOMMU supports PCIe ATS specification (see `capabilities` register), the
`EN_ATS` bit is used to enable ATS transaction processing. If `EN_ATS` is set
to 1, the IOMMU supports the following inbound transactions; otherwise they are
treated as unsupported transactions.

* TRANSLATION_REQUEST
* INVALIDATION_COMPLETION
* PAGE_REQUEST

If the `EN_ATS` bit is 1 and the `T2GPA` bit is set to 1 the IOMMU returns a GPA the
translation of an IOVA in a TRANSLATION_REQUEST from the device. When `T2GPA` is
1, the IOVA in translated memory accesses is a GPA and translated through the
G-stage page table to a PA. This control enables a hypervisor to contain
DMA from a device directly controlled by the guest OS, even with ATS capability
enabled, to the VMs memory.

[NOTE]
====
When `T2GPA` is enabled, the addresses provided to the device in response to a
TRANSLATION_REQUEST are not directly routable by the I/O fabric (e.g. PCI
switches) that connect the device to other peer devices and to host. Such
addresses are also not routable within the device even if peer-to-peer
transactions within the device (e.g. between functions of a device) are
supported.

Hypervisors that configure `T2GPA` to 1 must ensure through protocol specific
means that translated accesses are routed through the host such that the IOMMU
may translate the GPA and then route the transaction based on PA to memory or
to a peer device. For PCIe, for example, the Access Control Service (ACS) may
be configured to always redirect peer-to-peer (P2P) requests upstream to the
host.

Use of `T2GPA` set to 1 may not be compatible with devices that implement caches
tagged by the translated address returned in response to a TRANSLATION_REQUEST.
As an alternative to setting `T2GPA` to 1, the hypervisor may establish a trust
relationship with the device if authentication protocols are supported by the
device. For PCIe, for example, the PCIe component measurement and
authentication (CMA) capability provides a mechanism to verify the devices
configuration and firmware/executables (Measurement) and hardware identities
(Authentication) to establish such a trust relationship.
====

If `EN_PRI` bit is 0, then “Page Request” messages from the device are invalid
requests.

[NOTE]
====
When SR-IOV VF is used as a unit of allocation, a hypervisor may disable page
requests from one of the virtual functions by setting `EN_PRI` to 0. However the
page-request interface is shared by the PF and all VFs. The IOMMU protocol
specific logic is encouraged to classify this condition as a non-catastrophic
failure in its response to avoid the shared PRI in the device being disabled
for all PFs/VFs.
====

Setting the disable-translation-fault - `DTF` - bit to 1 disables reporting of
faults encountered in the address translation process. Setting `DTF` to 1 does
not disable error responses from being generated to the device in response to
faulting transactions. Setting `DTF` to 1 does not disable reporting of faults
from the IOMMU that are not related to the address translation process.

[NOTE]
====
A hypervisor may set `DTF` to 1 to disable fault reporting when it has
identified conditions that may lead to a flurry of errors such as due to an
abnormal termination of a virtual machine that may require the hypervisor to
reset the device.
====

The `fsc` field of `DC` holds the context for first-stage translations (S-stage
or VS-stage). The field holds the pointer to a PDT if the `PDTV` bit is 1.
If the `PDTV` bit is 0, the `fsc` field instead holds a pointer to a supervisor
first-stage page table (i.e. `iosatp`) if `iohgatp.MODE` is `Bare` and holds a
pointer to a virtual-supervisor first-stage page table (i.e. `iovsatp`) if
`iohgatp.MODE` is not `Bare`.

The `PDTV` is expected to be set to 1 when `DC` is associated with a device
that supports multiple process contexts and thus generates a valid `process_id`
with its memory accesses.

===== IO hypervisor guest address translation and protection (`iohgatp`)
The `iohgatp` field holds the PPN of the root G-stage page table and a
virtual machine identified by a guest soft-context ID (`GSCID`), to facilitate
address-translation fences on a per-virtual-machine basis. If multiple devices
are associated to a VM with a common G-stage page table, the hypervisor is
expected to program the same `GSCID` in each `iohgatp`. The MODE field is used
to select the G-stage address translation scheme.

This field controls the G-stage address translation and protection. The G-stage
page table formats and `MODE` encodings follow the format defined by the
privileged specification.

Implementations are not required to support all defined mode settings for
`iohgatp`. The IOMMU only needs to support the modes also supported by the MMU
in the harts integrated into the system.

  {bits: 16, name: 'GSCID'},
  {bits: 4,  name: 'MODE'},
], config:{lanes: 2, hspace: 1024, fontsize: 16}}
....


===== First-Stage context (`fsc`)
If `PDTV` is 0, the `fsc` field in `DC` holds the `iosatp` (when `iohgatp MODE`
is `Bare`) or the `iovsatp` (when `iohgatp MODE` is not `Bare`) that points to
a S-stage page table or VS-stage page table respectively.

  {bits: 16, name: 'reserved'},
  {bits: 4,  name: 'MODE'},
], config:{lanes: 2, hspace: 1024, fontsize: 16}}
....

The encodings of the `iosatp`/`iovsatp` `MODE` field are as the same as the
encodings for `MODE` field in the `satp` CSR.

When `PDTV` is 1, the `fsc` field holds the process-directory table pointer
(`pdtp`). When the device supports multiple process contexts, selected by the
`process_id`, the PDT is used to determine the first-stage page table and
associated `PSCID` for virtual address translation and protection.

The PDT is a 1, 2, or 3-level radix tree indexed using the process directory
index (`PDI`) bits of the `process_id`. The `pdtp` field holds the PPN of the root
page of the PDT and the `MODE` field that determines the number of levels of the
PDT.

....

When two-stage address translation is active (`iohgatp.MODE != Bare`), the `PPN`
field holds a guest PPN.  The guest physical address of the PDT root page is
then converted by guest physical address translation, as controlled by the
`iohgatp`, into a supervisor physical address. Translating addresses of PDT root
page through G-stage page tables, allows the PDT to be mapped into the
guest OS address space to allow the guest OS to directly edit the PDT to
associate a virtual-address space identified by a first-stage page table with
a `process_id`.

....

The `PSCID` field of `ta` provides the process soft-context ID that identifies
the address-space of the process. `PSCID` facilitates address-translation
fences on a per-address-space basis. The `PSCID` field in `ta` is used as the
address-space ID if `PDTV` is 0 and the `iosatp`/`iovsatp` `MODE` field is not
`Bare`.

===== MSI page table pointer (`msiptp`)

The `msiptp` field holds the PPN of the root MSI flat page table used to direct an
MSI to a guest interrupt file in an IMSIC. The MSI page table format is defined
in Section 9.5 of the Advanced Interrupt Architecture (AIA) specification.

The `MODE` field is used to select the MSI address translation scheme.

|===

===== MSI address mask (`msi_addr_mask`) and pattern (`msi_addr_pattern`)

The MSI address mask (`msi_addr_mask`) and pattern (`msi_addr_pattern`) fields
are used to recognize certain memory writes from the device as being MSIs. The
use of these fields is as specified in Section 9.4 of the Advanced Interrupt
Architecture specification.


=== Process-Directory-Table (PDT)

The PDT is a 1, 2, or 3-level radix tree indexed using the process directory
index (`PDI`) bits of the `process_id`.

The following diagrams illustrate the PDT radix-tree. The root
process-directory page number is located using the process-directory-table
pointer (`pdtp`) field of the device-context. Each non-leaf (`NL`) entry provides
the PPN of the next level process-directory-table page. The leaf
process-directory table entry holds the process-context (`PC`).

  {bits: 20, name: 'PSCID',    attr: '20'},
], config:{lanes: 2, hspace: 1024, fontsize: 16}}
....

`PC` is valid if the `V` bit is 1; if it is 0, all other bits in `PC` are don't
care and may be freely used by software.

When Enable-Supervisory-access (`ENS`) is 1, transactions requesting supervisor
privilege are allowed with this `process_id` else the transaction is treated as
an unsupported transaction.

When `ENS` is 1, the `SUM` (permit Supervisor User Memory access) bit
modifies the privilege with which supervisor privilege transactions access
virtual memory. When `SUM` is 0, supervisor privilege transactions to pages
mapped with `U`-bit in PTE set to 1 will fault.

When `ENS` is 1, supervisor privilege transactions that read with execute
intent to pages mapped with `U`-bit in PTE set to 1 will fault, regardless of
the state of `SUM`.

===== First-Stage context (`fsc`)
If `PDTV` is 0, the `fsc` field in `PC` holds the `iosatp` (when `iohgatp MODE`
is `Bare`) or the `iovsatp` (when `iohgatp MODE` is not `Bare`) that points to
a S-stage page table or VS-stage page table respectively.

.IO (Virtual)Supervisor addr. translation and prot. (iovsatp/iosatp) field (when PDTV is 1)

  {bits: 16, name: 'reserved'},
  {bits: 4,  name: 'MODE'},
], config:{lanes: 2, hspace: 1024, fontsize: 16}}
....

A valid (`V==1`) leaf PDT entry holds the PPN of the root page of a first-stage
page table and the `MODE` used to determine the first-stage address translation
scheme. The `MODE` field encodings are as defined for the `MODE` field in the
`satp`/`vsatp` CSR.

The software assigned process soft-context ID (`PSCID`) is used as the address
space ID of the process identified by the first-stage page table.

When two-stage address translation is active (`iohgatp MODE` is not `Bare`), the `PPN`
field holds a guest PPN of the first-stage page table. When two-stage address
translation is active, addresses of the first-stage page table entries are
then converted by guest physical address translation, as controlled by the
`iohgatp`, into a supervisor physical address. A guest OS may thus directly edit
the first-stage page table to limit access by the device to a subset of its memory
and specify permissions for the device accesses.

=== Caching in-memory data structures
To speed up Direct Memory Access (DMA) translations, the IOMMU may make use of
translation caches to hold entries from device-directory-table,
process-directory-table, S/VS and G-stage translation tables, MSI page
tables. These caches are collectively referred to as the IOMMU Address
Translation Caches (IOATC).

These IOATC do not observe modifications to the in-memory data structures using
explicit loads and stores by RISC-V harts or by device DMA. Software must use
the IOMMU commands to invalidate the cached data structure entries using IOMMU
commands to synchronize the IOMMU operations to observe updates to in-memory
data structures. A simpler implementation may not implement IOATC for some or
any of the in-memory data structures. The IOMMU commands may use one or
more IDs to tag the cached entries to identify a specific entry or a
group of entries.
